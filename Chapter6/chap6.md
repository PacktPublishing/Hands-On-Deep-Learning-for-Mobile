Speech recognition and language processing capabilities have become mainstream with the popularity of digital assistants like Siri and Alexa and various chatbots. These advances have been made possible due to the use of deep learning techniques to convert speech into text and applying natural language processing techniques to it.

A specialized network architecture, called _Recurrent Neural Networks_ or RNNs, is used extensively for these tasks. This chapter will focus on explaining how an RNN works and building RNN-based applications in text generation and speech recognition. We will build a joke generator, and a wake word detection algorithm, similar to 'Hey Siri' or 'Ok Google'.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:

- Building vector representation of words for NLP
- Different types of RNN architectures and cells like LSTM and GRU
- Generating text or completing sentences using RNN and word vectors
- Detecting words in speech / audio using RNNs

# Technical Requirements

This chapter uses Python, TensorFlow 2.0, Jupyter Notebooks for building and training the models. Data files from training are reused from Chapter 1 Github location. All the code for this chapter is in

<github-repo>/Chapter6/</github-repo>

For the mobile application pieces, an android-based mobile app will be built. It will be developed using Android Studio running on MacOS 10.13.6 or above. The models developed will be converted for mobile use as demonstrated in previous chapters, using TensorFlow Lite. Further, MLKit, part of Firebase, will be used to put the trained model into the app.
