Speech recognition and language processing capabilities have become mainstream with the popularity of digital assistants like Siri and Alexa and various chatbots. These advances have been made possible due to the use of deep learning techniques to convert speech into text and applying natural language processing techniques to it.

A specialized network architecture, called _Recurrent Neural Networks_ or RNNs, is used extensively for these tasks. This chapter will focus on explaining how an RNN works and building RNN-based applications in text generation and speech recognition. We will build a joke generator, and a wake word detection algorithm, similar to 'Hey Siri' or 'Ok Google'.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:

- Motivations for modeling sequences
- Different types of RNN architectures and cells like LSTM and GRU
- Overview of contemporary NLP techniques
- Building vector representation of words for NLP
- Generating text or completing sentences using RNN and word vectors
- Detecting words in speech/audio using RNNs

# Technical Requirements

This chapter uses Python, TensorFlow 2.0, Jupyter Notebooks for building and training the models. Data files from training are reused from Chapter 1 Github location. All the code for this chapter is in

<github-repo>/Chapter6/</github-repo>

For the mobile application pieces, an android-based mobile app will be built. It will be developed using Android Studio running on MacOS 10.13.6 or above. The models developed will be converted for mobile use as demonstrated in previous chapters, using TensorFlow Lite. Further, MLKit, part of Firebase, will be used to put the trained model into the app.

# Motivations for Recurrent Neural Networks

Fully connected deep learning networks, as introduced in Chapter 1, are doing well in a wide variety of cases. However, there are specific architectures that work better for specific types of data. In Chapter 5, we saw an example of CNN architecture which has higher accuracy in computer vision domain. Another very important domain is of sequences. The conventional way to think about sequences is time-series data. Voice or speech data fits very well with this view. The audio waveform changes over time and is usually chunked into 10 ms pieces for use in deep learning. Another way to think of an audio file is to model it as a sequence of 10 ms chunks.

A not so obvious example of sequences may be language. A sentence in a language is a set of words. However, these words have a certain organization - that is these words make a sentence only if they are in a certain order or a _sequence_. So, each sentence is a sequence of words. Notice the similarity in structure between an audio file represented as a sequence of 10 ms chunks and a sentence represented as a sequence of words. With appropriate featurization, these can be fed to an RNN.

The concept of modeling sequences is a very important and powerful one. It can be abstracted to suit a very large class of difficult tasks. Here are some additional examples of problems modeled as sequence learning:

- Robotic control: A robotic hand picking up an object needs to execute a set of steps, like rotation, extension, opening and closing the jaw. These sequences of steps can be modeled as a sequence. Using RNN architecture, these sequences can be learned for robotic control
- Speech Synthesis: We talked about speech recognition earlier. Speech synthesis is the exact opposite problem to this - given a set of text, generate the audio for it. Speech synthesis has gained prominence with the advent of chatbots and assistants like Siri and Alexa. The synthesized voices need to sound normal and not robotic.
- Handwriting recognition: The intuition behind this is the characters follow some distribution based on the language. Hence, the characters of a word and words in a sentence can be considered sequences. CNNs are used to extract features and coupled with RNNs to detect the right set of words. We will see this particular technique in this chapter by combining our CNN model from Chapter 5 with an RNN model to read sentences.
- Composing music: Given the periodic structure of music, it is a great application of RNN. It is one that brings the arts and computers closer. For some inspiration in composing music and art, check out

> > Info Box: A seminal paper titled "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" by Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, and Quoc Le laid the groundwork for solving a large class of problems through the sequence to sequence approach, available at: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>. The most famous of these is language translation, also referred to as _Neural Machine Translation_ or NMT. Approaches proposed in this paper enabled Google Translate to be written in 9 months and perform better than 8-9 years of successive improvements.
