Speech recognition and language processing capabilities have become mainstream with the popularity of digital assistants like Siri and Alexa, and various chatbots. These advances have been made possible due to the use of deep learning techniques to convert speech in to text and applying natural language processing techniques to it.

A specialized network architecture, called _Recurrent Neural Networks_ or RNNs, is used extensively for these tasks. This chapter will focus on explaining how an RNN works, and building RNN-based applications in text generation and speech recognition. We will build a joke generator, and a wake word detection algorithm, similar to 'Hey Siri' or 'Ok Google'.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:

// Your bulleted list of learning outcomes will correspond with the main H1 headings in the chapter. They will be the main topics the reader will explore. // Include page numbers for ease of reference

# Technical Requirements

// list technologies and installations required here.

// Provide Github URL for the code in the chapter (setup instructions should be on the Github page). Create a Github folder named, "chX", where X is the chapter number. For example, ch1

# H1 - Topic A // Add explanation and overview here

## H2 - Subtopic A // Add explanation/essential concepts

// Include examples, code, illustrations: explain complex concepts in clear, simple language

// Address the readers pain points: Address common pain points and areas of confusion.

## H2 - Subtopic B // Add explanation/essential concepts

// Include examples, code, illustrations: explain complex concepts in clear, simple language

// Address the readers pain points: Address common pain points and areas of confusion.

## H2 - Add further subtopics as required

# H1 - Topic B // Add explanation and overview here

// H2 - Subtopic B // Add explanation/essential concepts

# Summary

// Capture the key points and reinforce the structure of the book. You need to remind the reader what they have just learnt. Aim for a maximum of 200â€“300 words.

# Questions

// Add 7-10 questions here

// Include the answers in the Back Matter under a section titled, "Assessments"

# Further Reading

// Add additional references to useful Packt resources, or other information that might help explain a particular concept in further detail.
